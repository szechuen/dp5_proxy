This is a description of the DP5 protocol.  Lines not starting with :
give the generalized (parameterized) protocol.  Lines starting with :
give specific values for the parameters used in our implementation.

The protocol is configured for a maximum number of clients MAX_CLIENTS,
each with a maximum number of buddies MAX_BUDDIES.  Changing MAX_BUDDIES
requires telling the new value to all clients.  Changing MAX_CLIENTS
only requires telling the new value to the registration server.

: MAX_CLIENTS = 1000
: MAX_BUDDIES = 100

The players in this protocol are clients (up to MAX_CLIENTS of them),
one registration server, and NUM_PIRSERVERS PIR servers.

: NUM_PIRSERVERS = 5

1. Keys

Private keys are strings of PRIVKEY_BYTES bytes; public keys are strings
of PUBKEY_BYTES bytes.  The public keys represent elements of a group G
in which the Decision Diffie Hellman problem is hard; the private keys
represent integers mod ord(G).

: PRIVKEY_BYTES = PUBKEY_BYTES = 32
: Private keys and public keys are constructed according to
:   curve25519_donna
: The security level is about \sqrt{ord(G)}. If the private keys are
: represented without too much redundancy (as with curve25519_donna),
: then the security level is about 2^{4*PRIVKEY_BYTES}.

We assume all clients know all of their buddies' public keys, and their
own private keys.  How they learn this is out of scope for this
protocol.

2. Registration protocol

Time is divided into epochs of length EPOCH_LEN seconds.

: EPOCH_LEN = 1800 (30 minutes)

Clients who register as online during one epoch will appear online to
their buddies during the *next* epoch.

The "current epoch number" is floor(current_time / EPOCH_LEN), where
"current_time" is the Unix time.

The type Epoch is a 4-byte (EPOCH_BYTES) big-endian unsigned integer representing an
epoch number.

CLIENT:

Upon user input that the client is online:

a. Each client creates a list of the public keys of his buddies (whom he
wants to tell he is online).  Let the number of buddies be num_buddies.

b. For each public key P_i in the list, he combines it with his own
private key to form a Diffie-Hellman shared secret s_i. (1 <= i <=
num_buddies)

c. Express the next epoch number = (current epoch number + 1) as a
4-byte big-endian unsigned integer E.

d. Each s_i is hashed along with E to produce the key K_i = H_1(E, s_i)
of size SHAREDKEY_BYTES bytes.

: SHAREDKEY_BYTES = 10
: H_1(E, s) = SHA-256(0x00 || E || s) truncated to SHAREDKEY_BYTES bytes
: Note that we must have that 16^{SHAREDKEY_BYTES} >>
: MAX_BUDDIES*MAX_CLIENTS

e. The client must attach DATAPLAIN_BYTES bytes of associated data to
each buddy notification (for example, how to reach him; the exact
contents and format of the associated data is left to the application,
and is out of scope of this protocol).  Let D_i be the plaintext for
buddy i.  Compute the data key DK_i = H_2(E, s_i), which is of length
DATAKEY_BYTES bytes.

: DATAPLAIN_BYTES = 16
: DATAKEY_BYTES = 16
: H_2(E, s) = the last 16 bytes of SHA-256(0x00 || E || s)

f. Encrypt the data for each buddy i as ED_i = Enc_{DK_i}(D_i) producing
a ciphertext of length DATAENC_BYTES bytes.

: DATAENC_BYTES = 16
: Enc_k(x) = AES-128_k(x)

g. For num_buddies < i <= MAX_BUDDIES, set K_i to a random
SHAREDKEY_BYTES byte string and ED_i to a random DATAENC_BYTES byte
string.

h. Sort the array [K_1||ED_1, ..., K_{MAX_BUDDIES}||ED_{MAX_BUDDIES}]
and concatenate the elements of the result to yield sharedkeys.  Send 
the byte representation of the next epoch E and sharedkeys to the 
registration server.

C->R: E || Byte[(SHAREDKEY_BYTES+DATAENC_BYTES)*MAX_BUDDIES] sharedkeys

The following is out of scope for this protocol, but is a recommendation
to the implementor of the higher-level communication protocol: The
communication in the above step MAY be authenticated, either with an
explicit login, or with an anonymous credential that can be shown only
once in each epoch.  Clients SHOULD NOT execute the registration
protocol more than once in a given epoch.  Servers SHOULD reject clients
who attempt to execute the registration protocol more than once in a
given epoch.

REGISTRATION SERVER:

The server maintains a registration file corresponding to each epoch.

Upon receiving data from the client:

a. The registration server receives the next epoch and data from the 
   client, and parses it into an epoch and a series of (SHAREDKEY_BYTES
   +DATAENC_BYTES) bytes.

b. Express the next epoch number (current epoch number + 1) as a 4-byte
   big-endian unsigned integer E. Return to the client an error if it does 
   not match the received next epoch. For each (K_i,ED_i) chunk received
   from the client, hash E with each key to produce the hashed key
   HK_i = H_3(E, K_i), of size HASHKEY_BYTES bytes.

: HASHKEY_BYTES = 10
: H_3(E, x) = the first HASHKEY_BYTES of SHA-256(0x01 || E || x)

c. The server stores chunks (HK_i,ED_i) of size
   (HASHKEY_BYTES+DATAENC_BYTES) in the registration file for the *next*
   epoch (the current epoch number, plus one = next_epoch).  Set the
   byte err to 0 if no error occurred during the write to the file, or
   non-0 if an error occurred.  The non-0 value MAY indicate what the
   error was.

R->C: Byte err
      Epoch next_epoch

CLIENT:

Upon receiving a reply from the server:

a. If err == 0, report success to the user, and inform the user that he
   will be visible on line at the beginning of epoch next_epoch
   (converted to a human-readable date and time).  If err != 0, report
   failure to the user.

REGISTRATION SERVER:

Upon an epoch boundary time signal:

current_epoch is the new current epoch.  Registration file current_epoch
contains the shared keys that will be served during this epoch.

a. Create an empty epoch file current_epoch+1.

b. Read the epoch file current_epoch to retrieve the list of hashed keys
   and associated data that were uploaded by clients during the previous
   epoch.  Remove duplicate hashed keys from the list, resulting in
   num_keys unique hashed keys and associated encrypted data
   (HK_1,ED_1),...,(HK_{num_keys|,ED_{num_keys})

c. Compute the number of PRF buckets
   num_buckets = ceil(sqrt(max(num_keys, MAX_CLIENTS * MAX_BUDDIES) *
                           (HASHKEY_BYTES + DATAENC_BYTES) *
			   PIR_WORDS_PER_BYTE))

: PIR_WORDS_PER_BYTE is 8 if we're using Chor et al.'s simple PIR, or 1
: if we're using Goldberg's PIR.
: For our parameters, num_buckets = 4561 for Chor et al.'s PIR, or 1613
: for Goldberg's PIR, unless num_keys > 100,000.

d. Let M be a pseudorandom function family with keys being PRFKEY_BYTES
   byte strings and codomain {0,1,2,..,num_buckets-1}.

: We set PRFKEY_BYTES = 8 and M_k(x) to be computed as follows:
:    - Compute T = SHA-256(k || x)
:    - Treat the first 8 bytes of T as a little-endian 64-bit unsigned
:      integer T_int
:    - Output T_int mod num_buckets

e. Now we are going to use M to partition the (hashedkey,data) pairs
   into buckets.  By Chernoff bounds, we expect that with reasonable
   probability, putting m*k items randomly into k buckets will have the
   largest bucket no larger than m+sqrt(m).  So we make NUM_PRF_ITERS
   random partitions and keep the one with the smallest largest bucket:

: NUM_PRF_ITERS = 10

   Set best_prfkey = NULL and best_size = num_keys+1

   For iter from 1 to NUM_PRF_ITERS:

      Initialize unsigned long count[num_buckets] to all 0s.
      Initialize largest_bucket_size = 0.

      Pick a random PRFKEY_BYTES byte key prfkey.

      For k from 1 to num_keys:
        bucket = M_prfkey(HK_k)
	count[bucket] += 1
	if (count[bucket] > largest_bucket_size) {
	    largest_bucket_size = count[bucket]
	    if (largest_bucket_size >= best_size) {
		continue to next iteration of "iter" loop
	    }
	}

      best_prfkey = prfkey
      best_size = largest_bucket_size

f. Allocate num_buckets buckets, each of size
   best_size * (HASHKEY_BYTES + DATAENC_BYTES) bytes.
   For k from 1 to num_keys:
     bucket_num = M_{best_prfkey}(K_k)
     Append (K_k,ED_k) to bucket bucket_num

   Sort the (K_k,ED_k) elements within each bucket according to K_k.

   *Left-pad* any unused space in any bucket with bytes of 0x00.

g. We will create a data file and a metadata file for the current epoch.
   The datatype UInt denotes a UINT_BYTES byte big-endian unsigned
   integer.

: UINT_BYTES = 2

   Write the following to the metadata file:

   Byte[PRFKEY_BYTES] best_prfkey
   UInt num_buckets
   UInt best_size

   Write to the data file the (num_buckets * best_size *
   (HASHKEY_BYTES + DATAENC_BYTES)) bytes resulting from concatenating
   the num_buckets buckets.

h. Distribute the data file and the metadata file to the PIR servers,
   labelled with the current epoch number.  The distribution mechanism
   is outside the scope of this protocol, but it does not need to be
   confidential, as the contents of the data and metadata files can be
   considered public.

i. Delete the registration file for the current epoch.

3. Lookup protocol

CLIENT:

Upon user input that a client wishes to determine whether some number
(num_queries) of his buddies are online (technically, are online and
choosing to inform the client of that fact):
   
a. Compute the current epoch number current_epoch as above.  The client
   sends current_epoch to any PIR server to retrieve the current epoch
   metadata file.
   
C->P: Byte 0xff
      Epoch current_epoch

PIR SERVER:

Upon receiving a request for a metadata file:

a. Parse the 5-byte message to yield the requested epoch number.  If
   the first byte is not 0xff or this is not the current epoch number
   current_epoch, return the following message to the client:

P->C: Byte 0x00
      Epoch current_epoch

b. If the requested epoch is the current epoch, return the current
   epoch's metadata file to the client:

P->C: Byte METADATA_VERSION
      Epoch current_epoch
      Byte[PRFKEY_BYTES] prfkey
      UInt num_buckets
      UInt bucket_size

: METADATA_VERSION = 0x01
: Note that if PRFKEY_BYTES, SHAREDKEY_BYTES, HASHKEY_BYTES,
: DATAENC_BYTES, or UINT_BYTES change, or the definitions of H_1, H_2,
: M, or Enc change, METADATA_VERSION will need to change.

CLIENT:

Upon receiving a response to a metadata file request:
 
a. If the first byte of the response is 0x00, report an error to the
   user, and abort the protocol.  If the first byte is not the expected
   METADATA_VERSION, report an error to the user, and abort the
   protocol.

b. Otherwise, parse the above message to obtain values of prfkey,
   num_buckets, and bucket_size.

c. Express the current epoch number as a 4-byte big-endian unsigned
   integer E.  The client computes the Diffie-Hellman shared secrets s_i
   by combining his own private key with each of his buddy's public
   keys (1 <= i <= num_queries).

d. Produce the shared keys K_i = H_1(E, s_i) of size SHAREDKEY_BYTES
   bytes, hash them to produce HK_i = H_3(E, K_i) of size HASHKEY_BYTES
   and apply the PRF to each to produce the bucket numbers B_i =
   M_prfkey(HK_i).  Also produce the associated data keys
   DK_i = H_2(E, s_i).

e. Construct the set B = {B_1, ..., B_{num_queries}} (removing duplicates).
   Let |B| be the number of unique elements of B.  Find the smallest element
   of QUERY_SIZES (the set of allowed query sizes) that is greater than
   or equal to |B|.  Let this value be buckets_to_query.

: QUERY_SIZES = {1, MAX_BUDDIES}

f. Figure out if it is better to do PIR, or to download the whole data
   file: if NUM_PIRSERVERS * ( (num_buckets / PIR_WORDS_PER_BYTE) +
   (bucket_size * (HASHKEY_BYTES + DATAENC_BYTES)) ) * buckets_to_query
   < num_buckets * bucket_size * (HASHKEY_BYTES + DATAENC_BYTES) then
   perform step g below; otherwise, perform step h.

g. (Using PIR to retrieve the desired buckets.)  Construct a vector Q of
   length buckets_to_query, consisting of the (unique) elements of B,
   followed by (buckets_to_query - |B|) arbitrary elements of {0, 1, 2,
   ..., num_buckets-1}.  Pass NUM_PIRSERVERS, Q, num_buckets,
   bucket_size * (HASHKEY_BYTES + DATAENC_BYTES), and PRIVACY_LEVEL to
   Percy++ to produce the NUM_PIRSERVERS queries Q_1, ...,
   Q_{NUM_PIRSERVERS}.  For each 1 <= j <= NUM_PIRSERVERS, send query
   Q_j to PIR server j:

C->P_j: Byte 0xfe
        Epoch current_epoch
	Byte[] Q_j

    Do not perform step h.

: PRIVACY_LEVEL = 2
: PRIVACY_LEVEL is the number of PIR servers that can collude without
: revealing the client's queries.  You must have 0 < PRIVACY_LEVEL <
: NUM_PIRSERVERS.  For added robustness and Byzantine robustness, have 
: PRIVACY_LEVEL a little smaller than that.

h. (Downloading the entire data file.)  Send the following message to an
   arbitrary PIR server:

C->P: Byte 0xfd
      Epoch current_epoch

PIR SERVER:

Upon receiving a PIR query from a client:

a. Check that the first byte is 0xfe, and the next four bytes encode the
   current epoch.  If not, return the following message to the client:

P->C: Byte 0x80
      Epoch current_epoch

b. If the first five bytes are as expected, pass the remainder of the
   message as a client query to Percy++, operating on the current
   epoch's data file.  Let the response be resp.  Send the following
   message to the client:

P->C: Byte 0x81
      Epoch current_epoch
      Byte[] resp

Upon receiving a data file download request from a client:

a. Check that the first byte is 0xfd, and the next four bytes encode the
   current epoch.  If not, return the following message to the client:

P->C: Byte 0x80
      Epoch current_epoch

b. If the first five bytes are as expected, let the contents of the
   current epoch's data file be data_file.  Send the following message
   to the client:

P->C: Byte 0x82
      Epoch current_epoch
      Byte[] data_file

CLIENT:

Upon receiving a response from a PIR server:

a. Check the first five bytes of the response.  If the first byte is not
   0x81 or 0x82, or if the next four bytes do not encode the epoch
   number in the request, report an error to the user, and abort the
   protocol.

b. If the first byte was 0x81, store the resp portion of the result
   until you have PRIVACY_LEVEL+1 PIR server responses.  Once that
   happens, hand those responses to Percy++, which will return the
   contents of buckets_to_query buckets in response, corresponding to
   the elements of Q.

c. If the first byte of the received message was 0x82, extract the
   contents of the desired buckets: the contents of bucket i are bytes
   (i-1)*(bucket_size*(HASHKEY_BYTES + DATAENC_BYTES) through
   i*(bucket_size*(HASHKEY_BYTES + DATAENC_BYTES) - 1 of data_file
   (counting from 0).

d. Now for each of the hashed keys HK_i (1 <= i <= num_queries), look
   for HK_i in bucket B_i = M_prfkey(HK_i) using binary search on the
   (HK_k,ED_k) pairs.  If it is not present, the buddy corresponding to
   K_i is not reporting to this client that he is online.  If it is
   present, then use the DK_i computed earlier to decrypt
   D_i = Dec_{DK_i}(ED_i).  If D_i = \bottom (the decryption fails), the
   buddy is not reporting to this client that he is online (the HK_k
   match was a false positive).  Otherwise, the buddy is online, and D_i
   is the associated data.

: Dec_k(x) = AES-128^{-1}_k(x)
